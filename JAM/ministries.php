                        <h4>Children's Ministries</h4>
                        <p>
                            With more than 800,000 children living in Uganda without parents or guardians, 
                            it is easy to find those who are eager to join the family of kids in the Juna Amagara program. Here is a safe environment with good food, medical care, Christian love and a chance to go to school all under the watchful eyes of trained caregivers and guardians.  The number of orphans under our care grows every day.  All these children are verified as double-orphans. 
                            They will tell you Juna Amagara is saving their lives.

                        <h4>Education and Outreach</h4>
                        <p>
                            Children in Uganda believe that an education is the key to a successful life. 
                            In fact, if a student tests well in secondary school, he or she can earn a free university education. This is the dream, but there are so many students in the government’s free primary education system, the quality of education is poor. Juna Amagara is determined that the children in its programs will succeed in school, which is why we have opened our own primary and secondary schools. Amagara kids and local children study together. Fees collected from non-program children help to defray expenses.
                            The education is verified as superior by national testing.

                        <h4>Vocational Training</h4>
                        <p>
                            Raising orphans to be productive adults means preparing them for meaningful work. 
                            More than three dozen young women have graduated from 2-year programs that teach sewing and knitting skills.  Visiting Americans teach people sewing, craft-making and quilting skills, which are then passed on to others. Construction techniques, bricklaying, electrical installation, cooking and accounting are taught on-the-job through various Juna Amagara projects. 
                            Facilities are being built to widen the scope of vocations that may be taught.

                        <h4>Discipleship and Evangelism</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Bible tells us to take care of the widows and orphans. This we do in a way that makes God smile. Along the way, we teach Amagara children and students that they are a blessing from God and that they need to excel in a way that pleases Him. This is practical evangelism – keeping God at the center of our lives and showing others how to do the same.  Our Youth for Success conferences taking place throughout Uganda show young people the value of a God-centered life.  The Amagara Bible Institute for Discipleship and Evangelism (ABIDE) works with students going to university to build the servant-leaders of society. 
                            This highly successful program has graduated more than 50 young men and operates from two locations in Southwest Uganda.
