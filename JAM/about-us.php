                        Jerry is the President of Prairie Financial Services, Inc. in Naperville, IL and has been extremely active in supporting Christian mission organizations for more than 20 years.  Jerry and his wife Margaret are great friends of this ministry, having known Ben for nearly a decade.

                        Jerry has helped found Christian giving organizations and serves on the boards of directors of organizations.   He brings a unique point of view to the Board because wherever he goes, whoever he’s talking to - client, friend or the person in the seat next to him on an airplane, the message is always the same:  Everything belongs to God.  We are only stewards of the wealth he gives us.  This is an interesting philosophy for a financial manager, but along with managing client portfolios, he encourages people to set up donor advised funds to facilitate the giving away of money.  He quotes from The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn: "Once we understand we are giving away God’s money to do His work, 
                        we discover a peace and joy we never had when we thought it was our money."
